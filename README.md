# ALT-Assignment-1

This is a web page that displays my basic information, ALT SCHOOL ID, a biography, relevant details explaining why I joined the ALTSchool School of Engineering program, and my goals for the School of Engineering program. I implemented a fragment identifier feature to enable scrolling back to the top of the page.

NB: This is strictly without CSS.
